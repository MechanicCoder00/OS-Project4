Purpose : This program simulates an operating system process scheduling.

************Instructions**********
1. To compile: make
2. To run: oss
3. To clean up: make clean

************Output****************
logfileX.log     where X is a numerical value starting from 0(every 10k lines a new file will be created)

************Method of preventing starvation*************
Using the definition "#define STARVATIONPREVENTIONLIMITSEC 15" to set the wait limit of a process to 15 simulated
seconds, each process in priority queue levels 2 and 3 are checked for their current wait time since last being
processed.  Once this limit is reached the process is taken from whatever priority queue it was in(2 or 3) and placed
in the highest USER process priority queue(1 in this program,since 0 is only for REAL-TIME processes).

*******Other Constants********
Probability of a process termination = 2%
Probability of a process being a USER process = 90%
